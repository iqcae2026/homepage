<p>Co‑located Workshop @ SCA/HPCAsia 2026 — Osaka, Japan — 26 Jan 2026</p></section>
<h2>Welcome</h2><p>The iQCAE Workshop is an event where academia and industry come together to discuss the potential of quantum computer applications in CAE simulations. Our goal is to exchange ideas on the challenges faced in conventional CAE, explore possible solutions, and examine how quantum computers may help overcome these limitations.

The workshop consists of two parts:

Future visions shared by distinguished leaders from academia and industry.

Latest research results presented by up-and-coming researchers in the field.

We are delighted to host this event and look forward to your participation.</p>
